twatcher-lite
=============

This is a simplified version of the code that powers [Twatcher](http://twatcher.com). It mainly goes along with [my blog post]() and provides an easier way to follow along than manually copying and pasting the code from the blog into the various files.

Please refer to the blog post for instructions on how to install and run this application.

I'll eventually publish the full project, which includes configuration options, RSpec specs, etc. Stay tuned. :)
